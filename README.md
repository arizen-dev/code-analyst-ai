### ‚ú® Features
- **GitHub Repository Ingestion:** Clones any public GitHub repository via its URL.
- **Automated Architectural Summary:** Provides an immediate high-level analysis of the project's purpose, tech stack, and key files.
- **Deep Code Q&A:** Leverages a RAG pipeline to answer specific questions about the codebase.
- **Language-Aware Splitting:** Uses `langchain` and `tree-sitter` for intelligent, structure-preserving code chunking.
- **Modular & Professional Code Structure:** Demonstrates best practices by separating UI, core logic, and prompts.
- **Safe Resource Management:** Automatically creates and cleans up temporary directories for cloned repositories.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture & Workflow

The system uses a two-phase process: a one-time indexing pipeline to prepare the code, and an interactive Q&A pipeline for analysis.

The core of the Q&A functionality is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. When a user asks a question, the system finds the most relevant code snippets from the vector store and provides them to the LLM as context to generate a precise, code-grounded answer.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run Locally

1.  **Prerequisites:** You must have `git` and `git-lfs` installed on your system.

2.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/arizen-dev/code-analyst-ai.git
    cd code-analyst-ai
    ```

3.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # Install all required packages
    pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
    ```

4.  **Set up your API Keys:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the project root. Add your keys for both OpenRouter and OpenAI:
    ```
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_openrouter_api_key_here"
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    ```

5.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    chainlit run app.py -w
    ```
    Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000` to use the application.
